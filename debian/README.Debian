SwiftMailer for debian
----------------------

Upstream used to provied a file - lib/mime_types.php - with all mime-types 
used by SwiftMailer. With that new release, upstream provides now a 
script - lib/swiftmailer_generate_mimes_config.php - to generate that file. 
The script is intentionnally not executable. Feel free to change that.
